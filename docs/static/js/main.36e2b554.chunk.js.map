Taught by the book's authors, the course journey begins with a high-level overview of the language, discussing what it is and when it makes sense for development. Next, to ensure students have a basic understanding of the language, we'll review the general syntax, conventions, and idioms. This by no means a comprehensive review of the language but is instead intended to give a brief foundation upon which the subsequent examples will be built. Following this foundational overview, we begin the fun. We start by collaboratively developing a basic HTTP server and a client implant that interacts with the server. As part of this, we'll explore HTTP communications and detail how to very cleanly work with JSON payloads. We'll have the students cross-compile their implants for easy distribution across architectures. As time permits, students will be adding to it the ability to remotely execute operating system commands, increasing security of our interactions by adding authentication and encryption, adding the ability to execute raw shellcode, and creating a concurrent port scanner used by an implant to scan internal network resources./\",/\"prereqs/\":[{/\"req/\":/\"Basic understanding of Go

Unfortunately, many security teams focus on the detection of infiltration, data loss, or response after an attack. This focus skips over a more proactive approach to preventing the attack during the planning stages. There is a plethora of information publically available about a company and its employees that is collected prior to an attack. This information is used to find vulnerabilities in information systems. The information is also used to plan out social engineering which is used to gain system credentials or additional information about a company.\"},{\"title\":\"Bash Bunny Basics\",\"speaker\":[{\"name\":\"Anthony Bernard\",\"speaker_id\":\"abernard\",\"company\":\"\",\"twitter\":\"\",\"github\":\"\",\"linkedin\":\"\",\"image\":\"\",\"bio\":\"I am a young 13 year old.

Taught by the book's authors, the course journey begins with a high-level overview of the language, discussing what it is and when it makes sense for development. Next, to ensure students have a basic understanding of the language, we'll review the general syntax, conventions, and idioms. This by no means a comprehensive review of the language but is instead intended to give a brief foundation upon which the subsequent examples will be built. Following this foundational overview, we begin the fun. We start by collaboratively developing a basic HTTP server and a client implant that interacts with the server. As part of this, we'll explore HTTP communications and detail how to very cleanly work with JSON payloads. We'll have the students cross-compile their implants for easy distribution across architectures. As time permits, students will be adding to it the ability to remotely execute operating system commands, increasing security of our interactions by adding authentication and encryption, adding the ability to execute raw shellcode, and creating a concurrent port scanner used by an implant to scan internal network resources.\",\"prereqs\":[{\"req\":\"Basic understanding of Go (preferred)\"}],\"equipment\":[{\"req\":\"Laptop with some type of virtualization software with the ability to run a Linux VM with Go version 1.12.5 or later installed and configured or a Windows VM (preferred).\"},{\"req\":\"Guest / host OS with curl or similar.\"},{\"req\":\"Provided - Copy of the book Black Hat Go.\"}]}];","module.exports = [{\"title\":\"Radio Hacking 101 with RTL-SDR\",\"id\":\"rtlsdr\",\"hidden\":false,\"instructor\":[{\"name\":\"Gus Gorman\",\"twitter\":\"\",\"bio\":\"Gus Gorman, BS in Bioinformatics from UNO.

information security professionals who recognized the opportunity to create an awesome security conference in Omaha.  The idea for Kernelcon started within the local DEF CON Group, <a className=\"text-highlight\" href=\"http://dc402.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">DC402</a>, with lots of help from other members of other local security groups such as <a className=\"text-highlight\" href=\"https://www.nebraskacert.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NebraskaCERT</a> and <a className=\"text-highlight\" href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Omaha\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OWASP</a>.  We are inspired by many other conferences including DEF CON, DerbyCon, ShmooCon, etc., and wanted to bring those same experiences to the Mid-West here in Omaha.</p>\n            <p className='tab-paragraph'>Our goal is to make Omaha an annual destination for security professionals around the world that want to have a unique conference experience.</p>\n            <p className='tab-paragraph'>We hope you enjoy the conference as much as we did planning it.</p>\n          </TabPanel>\n          <TabPanel tabId=\"code-of-conduct\">\n            <div className='tab-title'>Code Of Conduct</div>\n            <div className='code-of-conduct-text'>\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>Kernelcon provides a forum for open discussion between participants, where radical viewpoints are welcome and a high degree of skepticism is expected. However, insulting or harassing other participants is unacceptable. We want Kernelcon to be a safe and productive environment for everyone. It's not about what you look like but what's in your mind and how you present yourself that counts at Kernelcon.</p>\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>We do not condone harassment against any participant, for any reason. Harassment includes deliberate intimidation and targeting individuals in a manner that makes them feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or afraid.</p>\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. We reserve the right to respond to harassment in the manner we deem appropriate, including but not limited to expulsion without refund and referral to the relevant authorities.</p>\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>This Code of Conduct applies to everyone participating at Kernelcon - from attendees and exhibitors to speakers, press, volunteers, and Kernelcon Crew.</p>\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>Anyone can report harassment. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you can contact a Kernelcon Crew member, go to the registration desk, or info booth.</p>\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel security, local law enforcement, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of Kernelcon.</p>\n              <p className='about-sub-text'>Remember: The CON is what you make of it, and as a community we can create a great experience for everyone.</p>\n            </div>\n          </TabPanel>\n          <TabPanel tabId=\"reciprocity\">\n            <div className='reciprocity'>\n              <div className='wording'>\n                <div className='tab-title'>Stronger Together</div>\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>Some hacker conferences (or \"cons\") have developed a tradition of awarding a coveted, relatively rare, token to deserving folks.  Typically, the primary recipient of these tokens are the champions of the most difficult competitions conducted at the con.  For instance, the primary CTF contest is often a \"Black Badge event.\"</p>\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>In addition to the accolades, the awarding of these tokens often carry other benefits.  Perhaps the most common is free entry to the conference for life.  </p>\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>Not all conferences are the same, and many bestow other perks with the token.  Some cons take the right to anonymity very seriously, while others require attributed registration for their conference.</p>\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>One common characteristic to most hacker (and security, infosec, etc) cons, is the underpinning natural curiosity found in attendees, but keenly present in those that elect to spend their conference time competing in events.  Often these events are \"winner-takes-all\" with little or no perks for places other than first.</p>\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>Another very common characteristic is the sense of community.  Each con develops its own sense of community, but there is also a sense of togetherness that spans cons, not owned or governed by any one con, but embodied by all.</p>\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>Merging these components is long past due.  Starting today, with the end of DerbyCon, several peers in the community will begin honoring not only DerbyCon's black badge holders with free registration at their own conferences, but also each others.  Our hope is that this black badge reciprocity brings us even closer together as a community while also strengthening the ingrained traditions of curiosity and competition.</p>\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>The specifics of how each conference will handle things like registration complexities are actively being worked out, but many have confidence that the problem is tractable.  Accordingly, several are already pledging broad support, and each venue will ultimately be individually communicating details pertinent to registration.</p>\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>#strongertogether</p>\n                <p className='tab-paragraph'>#hackercommunity</p>\n              </div>\n              <div className='logo-space'>\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/_kernelcon_'\n                  target='_blank'\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\n                  <img src={Kernelcon}\n                    alt='kernelcon-logo'\n                    className='con-logo-flip' />\n                </a>\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/grrcon'\n                  target='_blank'\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\n                  <img src={GrrCon}\n                    alt='grrcon-logo' />\n                </a>\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/DerbyCon'\n                  target='_blank'\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\n                  <img src={DerbyCon}\n                  className='con-logo-flip'\n                    alt='derbycon-logo' />\n                </a>\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/thotcon'\n                  target='_blank'\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\n                  <img src={ThotCon}\n                  className='con-logo-flip'\n                    alt='thotcon-logo'/>\n                </a>\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/cyphercon'\n                  target='_blank'\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\n                  <img src={Cyphercon}\n                  className='con-logo-flip-flip'\n                    alt='cyphercon-logo'/>\n                </a>\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/wwhackinfest'\n                  target='_blank'\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\n                  <img src={wwhackinfest} \n                    alt='wwhf-logo'/>\n                </a>\n                <a href='http://twitter.com/texas_cyber'\n                  target='_blank'\n                  rel='noopener noreferrer'>\n                  <img src={texas_cyber} \n                    alt='texas_cyber-logo'/>\t\t\t\n                </a>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </TabPanel>\n          <TabPanel tabId=\"organizers\">\n            <Organizers />\n          </TabPanel>\n          <TabPanel tabId=\"contact\">\n            <div className='text-area'>\n              <div className='tab-title'>Stay in Touch</div>\n              <div className='tab-paragraph'>We've got the social!

Expecting end users to invent complex passwords for every web site they visit is untenable. Wouldn't it be great if there was some new technology that uses public key exchange and biometrics to get rid of passwords all together?  Well, that technology is here. WebAuthn (Web Authentication) is a web standard published in 2019 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The goal of the project is to standardize an interface for authenticating users to web-based applications and services using public-key cryptography instead of passwords. Despite being an emerging technology, this standard has already been adopted by leading browsers and platforms.  This talk aims to shed light the technical details of what WebAuthn is and how it works. We will also cover the security pros and cons of this new standard and make predictions about what this may mean for the future of web application security. This is an introductory talk.

I am here to discuss why Physical Penetration Testing/Physical Red Teaming is not only beneficial, but also crucial to a company's security well-being. I will review what physical red teaming is, how physical red teaming differs from traditional physical penetration tests, some of the tactics used in bypassing physical security controls, how closely tied physical security is to the overall posture and effectiveness of security training programs and policies, and will give several scenarios in which a physical intrusion opened several more doors (pun intended) during Red Team excursions.\", \"Let The Right One In\", 'David Boyd', '2')}>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"box\">\n\t              \t<span className=\"talk-time\">1620</span>\n\t              \t<span>Let The Right One In</span>\n\t            \t</div>\n\t            </a>\n\n            </div>\n        \t</div>\n        }\n\n        {this.state.showSaturday &&\n        \t<div>\n        \t\t<div className='schedule'>{`Tentative ${day} Speaking Schedule`}</div>\n        \t\t<div className='grid-wrapper-saturday'>\n\t            <div className=\"track\">Bat of Doom</div>\n\t            <div className=\"track\">Terrified Chipmunk</div>\n\t            <a className=\"both-tracks\"\n\t            \tonClick={this.popModal('Registration Open', '0730', '1720', 'Registration will be in the courtyard area until Friday Keynote and located at the store between the two main tracks.')}>\n\t              <div className=\"box\">\n\t                <span className=\"talk-time\">0730</span>\n\t                <span>Registration Open</span>\n\t              </div>\n\t            </a>\n\t            <a className=\"both-tracks\"\n\t            \tonClick={this.popModal('Opening Remarks', '0850', '0900', 'Opening Remarks from Kernelcon Organizers.')}>\n\t              <div className=\"box\">\n\t                <span className=\"talk-time\">0850</span>\n\t                <span>Opening Remarks</span>\n\t              </div>\n\t            </a>\n\t            <a className=\"both-tracks\"\n\t            \tonClick={this.popModal('Keynote', '0900', '1000', \"Digital markets have quickly grown to international proportions, complexities in materials, development, and distribution have developed accordingly, resulting in market efficiency and, often overlooked, incalculable risks.

Keep your schedule open, and stay excited for an outstanding virtual Kernelcon experience.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p className='tab-paragraph'>Going virtual was not an easy decision, and one that warranted heavy consideration.  We had a vision for the conference, and this wasn’t quite it.  We’ll do what hackers always do, evolve and adapt to the circumstances.  There is certainly an economic impact to those that booked travel, to our venue, and our financial status.   While there are tangible benefits to the in-person conference, those in our community who supported Kernelcon last year will feel right at home.  We aim to make the virtual experience a great one.  For experiences that we can’t take virtual we will use all of our work this year to make them even better next year.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p className='tab-paragraph'>Updates will be made to the website, communicated via social media, and sent directly to pre-registered attendees.

We accept designs from attendee's family members too! It would be wonderful to include as many people as we can!</p>\n            <p className='tab-paragraph'>Are you still interested?
